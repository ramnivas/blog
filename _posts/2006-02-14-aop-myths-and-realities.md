IBM developerWorks has published my [AOP myths and realities](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-aopwork15) article. In this article, I examine the following common myths around AOP and discuss their realities. Do you have or have you heard of other myths? Let me know. Perhaps I can address them in another article:

**Update:** There is [a good discussion of this article at TheServerSide.com](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=39026).
