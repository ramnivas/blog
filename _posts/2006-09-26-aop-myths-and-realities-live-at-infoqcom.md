[InfoQ.com](http://infoq.com) has published my [AOP myths and realities](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/AOP-Myths-and-Realities) talk recorded at a [No Fluff Just Stuff](http://nofluffjuststuff.com) conference.

InfoQ.com founded by Floyd Marinescu and  Alexandru Popescu (the 'mindstorm') is definitely becoming a great portal for enterprise developers. Besides great contents (increasing every day), InfoQ is also featuring a few innovative ideas (a lot more to come, as I understand from talking to Floyd and Alexandru). I like, for example, how the live presentations are featured with both slides and presenter seen simultaneously. This format, I believe, gives a much better sense of "being there".
