[AspectJ in Action, second edition](http://manning.com/laddad2/) is just published. You can get sample chapters, source code, and more from the book's web site. You may especially want to read [a real world perspective of AOP](http://manning.com/laddad2/excerpt_perspectiveAOP.html).

This book took over 3 years to get from proposal to completion and I am glad to have it published finally. It was a lot of work with updates and re-updates, but I am pleased with the end results.

Now that I have taken the dust off my blog, I plan to blog more steadily.
