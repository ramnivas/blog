[The Spring Experience 2006](http://thespringexperience.com) program details are now available. [Keith Donald](http://www.interface21.com/people/keith.html) and [Jay Zimmerman](http://nofluffjuststuff.com) have been working very hard to put together a great show resulting in a three-day conference packed with over [50 sessions](http://www.thespringexperience.com/show_topics.jsp?showId=45) covering a wide range of topics. It is not just learning either; there are a few parties including a beach party (complete with TSE2006 beach towel :-)).

I will be presenting f[our sessions](http://www.thespringexperience.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=719&showId=45) and will be attending many to learn all the interesting things other speakers have been working on.
