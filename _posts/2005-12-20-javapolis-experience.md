Just came back from the Javapolis conference. It was a busy, exhausting, but most importantly, a fun-filled week. Thanks [Stephane Janssen](http://javapolis.com/confluence/display/~stephan) and [Frederik Santens](http://www.bejug.org/confluenceBeJUG/display/BeJUG/Frederik+Santens) for inviting me.

I had a pretty busy schedule: [one university session](http://javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP05/Practical+AOP), [one conference session](http://javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP05/What%27s+new+in+AOP), [one BOF](http://javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP05/AOP+Myths+and+Realities), and three interviews. It was quite a different experience to present in a movie theater with slides projected on the whole screen. The best parts were after the talks when many attendees came by and declared themselves as "AOP converts".

For BOF, I was up against [King Kong](http://javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP05/JavaPolis+Movie)! I wasn't expecting many to attend the BOF session. To my surprise, some hard core developers preferred intelligent discussion on [myths and realities of AOP](http://javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP05/AOP+Myths+and+Realities) over some mindless movie! As a result, we had some great conversation.

I had the privilege of pair-programming with [Rod Johnson](http://interface21.com/people/rod.html) on a transaction management aspect. Spring 2.0's integration with AspectJ will definitely prove to be a highlight of 2006.

Looking forward to next year's Javapolis!
