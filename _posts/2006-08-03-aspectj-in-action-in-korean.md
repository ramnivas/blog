[AspectJ in Action](http://ramnivas.com/ajia.html) has been [translated](http://blog.naver.com/josephke?Redirect=Log&logNo=40016526835) [into](http://www.bandibook.com/search/subject_view.php?code=2487044&reurl=%252Fcategory%252Fcategory_3.html%253Flcode%253D14%2526scode%253D1407%2526mcode%253D140700) [Korean](http://kangcom.com/common/bookinfo/bookinfo.asp?sku=200508170002). While the Korean translation seems to have happened back in late 2005, only now I could confirm it (thanks to my friend Henry Choi for ensuring that I didnâ€™t get lost in translation).
